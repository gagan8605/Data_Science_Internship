# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains three machine learning projects:
1. **Iris Flower Classification** – Classify iris flowers into three species based on measurements.
2. **Unemployment Analysis** – Analyze and visualize unemployment rates.
3. **Car Price Prediction** – Predict car prices based on various factors.

Each project includes dataset links, implementation steps, and instructions for running the models.

## Project 1: Iris Flower Classification
### Objective
Classify iris flowers into three species (**Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**) based on their measurements.

### Dataset
- The dataset can be found in the Scikit-learn library or can be downloaded from [here](#).

### Steps to Implement
1. Import necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`).
2. Load and explore the dataset.
3. Preprocess data (handle missing values, normalize features if necessary).
4. Split data into training and testing sets.
5. Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
6. Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
7. Deploy the model if required.

### Run the Project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python iris_classification.py
```

## Project 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
### Objective
Analyze unemployment trends using Python and visualize insights.

### Dataset
- The dataset can be downloaded from [here](#).

### Steps to Implement
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Clean and preprocess the data.
4. Visualize unemployment trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. Perform statistical analysis.
6. Generate insights and report findings.

### Run the Project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python unemployment_analysis.py
```

## Project 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
### Objective
Predict car prices based on multiple features such as brand, horsepower, mileage, and other specifications.

### Dataset
- The dataset can be downloaded from [here](#).

### Steps to Implement
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis.
3. Select relevant features and encode categorical variables.
4. Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
5. Evaluate the model using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
6. Deploy the model if needed.

### Run the Project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python car_price_prediction.py
```
